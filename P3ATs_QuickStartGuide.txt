Go to http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/Aria

Donwload and install the appropriate version of the ARIA library (used to communicate with the Pioneer-like robots)

To check that everything is working up to this point, turn on the robot, connect it to the serial port of the PC and run: /usr/local/Aria/examples/demo
    If you are using a RS232-USB adapter, you will need to indicate the correct port to use: /usr/local/Aria/examples -rp /dev/ttyUSB0
    If you are having permissions problems and want to run without sudo (needed for ROS), add yourself to the dialout group: sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
        You might need to logoff and on again for the change to take effect

If everything is ok you should be able to control the robot with the keyboard arrows and space bar to stop it. To get a report on the robot status, press "o" or "f". To exit press scape. 


ROS
Clone and build the rosaria package in your catkin workspace:
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git src/rosaria
    catkin_make


Now test connection with:
    roscore
    (another terminal) rosrun rosaria RosAria
                                            

If everything is ok, you should now be able to control the robot with:

rostopic pub -r 10 /RosAria/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.01
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0"

  
or: roslaunch joystick joystick topic:=/RosAria/cmd_vel


Get the sonnar readings with: rostopic echo /RosAria/sonar

To visualize the sonnar readings along with a model of the robot:
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-p2os-urdf
    roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3at_urdf.launch
    rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 base_link sonar 10
    rviz
